# Zenefits Coding Challenge

Thank you for inviting me to complete this coding challenge! I decided to implement my solution in two ways. The first way is with Vanilla Javascript, providing event listeners and manipulating the DOM directly. The second way uses React to render all components and handle events.

### Technologies Used
- Javascript (ES6)
- Google Maps API
- Google Places API
- React.js
- HTML5/CSS3
- Webpack/Babel


## Vanilla JS

Navigate to `/VanillaPlaceFinder` and run `open index.html` in the terminal. Be sure to enable location services when the browser prompts for consent.

## React

Navigate to `/ReactPlaceFinder` and run the following commands in the terminal:

1. `npm install` - Will install all dependencies and generate the necessary bundle.js file
2. `open index.html`

Again, be sure to enable location services when the browser prompts for consent.

## Features
- Users can search by keyword and filter results by distance or popularity.
- Map continuously repopulates search results as user scrolls around.
- Both list items and corresponding markers can be clicked to access an infoWindow, which can be clicked to open more information in another browser tab.
- Custom Marker Icons for places and current location. Click on your location to personalize!
- Resizable List and Map
